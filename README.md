 üìê 1. Similarity Computation

We compute similarities between each pair of product descriptions using two techniques:

 üîπ TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity
 üîπ Jaccard Similarity

üìå 3. Observations

- Cosine similarity highlights semantic closeness even if exact words differ.
- Jaccard is stricter, and better at exact duplicates
- TF-IDF + Cosine is more effective for identifying related product styles
